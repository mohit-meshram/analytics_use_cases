## General Information
- Project involves building Advanced regression model using Ridge and Lasso Regularisation for predicting housing prices. The data used is surpise housing company data. Goal of the project is to identify most important predictors and how well these predictors describes the prices.


## Conclusions
Most important Params according to Ridge regression are - Neighbourhood of Northridge and Northridge heights, Living area above ground, Very Excellent Overall Quality, full bathrooms,
Most important according to lasso are - living area above ground, Overall quality of excellent and very excellent, good pool quality, proximity to offsite features
